# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# HOW TO USE THIS FILE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file is ingested by the RAG backend (backend/main.py) and used to
# answer questions about you inside the AI Guide chat assistant.
#
# Replace the sections below with your own story. The more vivid and specific
# you are, the better the AI will answer questions about you. Write in first
# person, narrative style -- this is your voice, not a resume.
#
# Suggested sections (customize freely):
#
#   ## Early Life & Origin Story
#   Where did you grow up? What were you obsessed with as a kid?
#   What made you want to go into tech / engineering / your field?
#
#   ## Education
#   Where did you study? What did you build or discover there?
#   Any turning-point moments, competitions, side projects?
#
#   ## Career Timeline
#   Walk through each role: what you did, what you learned, the human story
#   behind the job title. Include dates, companies, and memorable moments.
#
#   ## Key Projects
#   Deep-dives on your most impressive or meaningful work.
#   What was the problem? What did you build? What was the impact?
#
#   ## Fun Facts / Personal Side
#   Hobbies, quirks, things that make you YOU. Recruiters remember people,
#   not resumes. Give them something to remember.
#
#   ## What You're Building Now
#   Current projects, research, or side hustles.
#
#   ## Contact
#   Preferred way for people to reach you.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TIP: The backend chunks this file and embeds it into a vector store.
# Longer, more detailed content = better RAG retrieval = smarter AI answers.
# Aim for at least 500-1000 words across all sections.
